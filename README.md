## üìå Background & Overview

### Objective:

### üìñ What is this project about? 

-Performs RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis on e-commerce retail data to segment customers

-Aims to improve customer retention, purchase frequency, and customer lifetime value (CLV)

-Provides actionable marketing and sales strategies for a Superstore to target key customer segments

### Business problem
Retail/online business has a large number of customers but does not know which groups are high value, which groups are at risk of losing, which groups need to be reactivated. System: scattered marketing costs, low leg cost extraction, low advertising ROI. This project provides a process to:

-Classify customers by value (RFM)

-Tip marketing campaigns for each group

-Export the list to CRM/email tool for implementation

-Measure the level of improvement (added value) after the campaign

### üë§ Who is this project for? 

-Marketing team

-Sales team

-Business Analysts/Management

### What is RFM ? How RFM impact on business ?

-Recency (R): time since last purchase. Recent buyers are more likely to repurchase ‚Üí prioritize upsell targets.

-Frequency (F): frequency of purchases over a period of time. Frequent buyers are loyal customers.

-Monetary (M): total spending value. Indicates how much revenue customers contribute.

-->Impact on business: RFM helps allocate marketing budget effectively (e.g. prioritize retaining Champions, reactivating At-Risk), optimize CPA/ROI, increase retention and CLV.

## ‚öíÔ∏è Main Process :

1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Technique:

-Choose the reference 2011-12-31. Get the most recent purchase date of each customer (max())

-Calculate the number of days from the most recent purchase to the reference date 

-Count the number of different bills (nunique()) for each customer

-Create column Monetary = quantity * unit price

-Sum the purchase value (sum()) for each customer

-Merge 3 tables Recency, Frequency, Monetary into one summary table.

-Divide each index into 5 groups (quintiles). Recency: high score = recent purchases. Frequency & Monetary: high score = frequent purchases & high value. Generate RFM codes in a string, for example 543 = Recency 5, Frequency 4, Monetary 3.

-Get the columns needed for analysis or visualization.

Operation:

-Recent indicates whether the customer has recently purchased. Low value ‚Üí recent purchase, high probability of returning.

-Frequency indicates how often a customer purchases. High value ‚Üí loyal or repeat customers

-Monetary shows the financial value that the customer brings. High value ‚Üí the customer has great value to the business.

-Prepare data to classify customers according to RFM model.

-Allows to classify customers into different groups (VIP, potential, risk‚Ä¶).

-This is the RFM analysis results table, used to make marketing and customer care decisions.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- RFM Customer Segmentation: Count the number of customers in each Segment to evaluate the descriptive price and ability of each group. Helps identify VIP customers, new customers, abandoned customers, etc

- Relationship between recency and frequency: Use heat maps to observe trends: customers who buy frequently also have low Recency (i.e. recent interactions).

- Customer Percentage by Segment: The pie chart illustrates the percentage of each Segment group, supporting the balance of customer retention and expansion strategies

- Top 5 countries by number of customers and Segments: Identify key markets and Segment distribution levels in each country, serving localization marketing strategies

- Distribute Recency, Frequency, Monetary: Histogram + KDE helps understand purchasing behavior characteristics: most customers buy less often but a few contribute large revenue.

- Analyze Customer Lifetime Value (CLV): Calculate CLV = Frequency √ó Monetary, log-transform to reduce skewness. Group CLV into Low, Medium, High to prioritize high-value customer care resources

- Customer trends over time: Area chart shows the change in the number of customers in each Segment by month, helping to identify seasonality and the impact of marketing campaigns

- Top popular products by CLV group: Identify key products in each CLV group, supporting targeted cross-selling and up-selling.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Python Analysis

-Identified skewed distributions: Recency showed recent purchases clustering, Frequency was low for most customers, and Monetary was driven by a few high-spenders.

-Top products like "MEDIUM CERAMIC TOP STORAGE JAR" and "JUMBO BAG RETROSPOT" dominated low and high CLV segments, respectively.

-Seasonal peaks (May-August) and post-seasonal drops (September-December) highlighted retention challenges.

-Visualization to show the key

-VIP customer group (R=5, F=5, M=5) accounts for a small proportion but contributes a large amount of revenue ‚Üí is a key group that needs to maintain and develop relationships.

-New customer group (high R, low F, medium M) has growth potential if nurtured through good promotions and onboarding programs

-The group of customers who have left (low R, low F, low M) is at risk of being lost if there is no reactivation program

-The main markets (top 5 countries) account for the majority of revenue, while many other countries have very low revenue ‚Üí focus marketing resources on the main markets to optimize ROI

-Best-selling products are different between low, medium, and high CLV groups ‚Üí can use the main product of the high CLV group to upsell to the low/medium CLV group

-Seasonal purchasing trends (number of customers increases sharply in certain months) ‚Üí opportunity to plan promotions at the right time

## üîé Final Conclusion & Recommendations

üìå Key Takeaways:

- Retain VIP groups
‚Üí Create premium loyalty programs, special offers, and personalized care to maintain high revenue

- Increase purchase frequency for new customers

-Focus on key markets
‚Üí Focus on advertising budgets and expand distribution channels in countries with high revenue

-Optimize seasonal marketing campaigns
